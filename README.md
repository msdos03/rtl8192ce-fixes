# rtl8192ce-fixes
The mac80211 driver of rtl8192ce is very unstable, so this rtl871x driver is to solve this problem. This will be ported to latest Linux kernel. 

The current rtlwifi and rtl8192ce the old released driver by realtek are both mac80211 drivers, they seemed to be greatly reduced and without many functions. 

This driver is found in some custom 3.0 kernel repos, If anyone have a newer version of this driver, please make a pull request.
